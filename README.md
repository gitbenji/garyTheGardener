# Gary The Gardener

Get rid of the messy whiteboards! Finally, a Facebook messenger bot to keep track of maintenance in the house garden! 
Users can message Gary to let him know when they have watered the garden. Currently, Gary will notify the caretakers of 
the garden to water the plants if Gary has not been notified of watering by 10am and 6pm each day (veggies should be 
lightly watered until soil is just moist, twice daily).

## Getting Started

## Plans To Do

Create keys per house/garden which allows a user to register a new garden with Gary and add users to that garden.

Integrate weather apis (like WeatherSTEM) to notify Gary of rain and edit notifications accordingly.
